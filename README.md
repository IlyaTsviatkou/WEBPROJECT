# Project Overview
---
The web application is an online collection of tops. The online collection contains a catalog of tops with rating. The administrator manages the catalog, controls the availability of tops, accepts or declines reports, and controls user access. To place an top, a client needs to register using an up-to-date e-mail and confirm it, after which it becomes available to manage his tops and profile.
